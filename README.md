============

Some things I wrote on my journey learning Haskell.

I use .lhs files in Bird-Style for describing the functions.
Not everything I wrote is in english.
If you want something translated feel free to ask or submit an issue.
This is all work in progress... and maybe never done...

This library is only meant for me, but I welcome everyone who correct
typos, incorrect code or translate my description into english. ;)
