haskellstuff
============

Some things I wrote in haskell, just for fun.

I use .lhs files in Bird-Style for describing the functions.
Not everything I wrote is in english, some parts are in german.
If you want something translated feel free to ask or submit an issue.
This is all work in progress...

This library is only meant for me, but I welcome everyone who correct
typos or translate my description into english. ;)
